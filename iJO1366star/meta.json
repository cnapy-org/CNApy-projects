{"description": "iJO1366*\nThis model is based on iJO1366 [1], but enhanced with enzyme constraints according to the sMOMENT method using AutoPACMEN [2]. This model is also published in [2]. The protein pool pseudo-reaction is called ER_pool_TG_ (its upper bound defines the total protein amount per dry biomass) and the protein pool pseudo-metabolite is called prot_pool.\n[1] https://doi.org/10.1038/msb.2011.65 \n[2] https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-3329-9", "format version": 2}
