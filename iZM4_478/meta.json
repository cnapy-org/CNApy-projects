Model-driven analysis of mutant fitness experiments improves genome-scale metabolic models of Zymomonas mobilis ZM4. PLoS Comput Biol. 2020 Aug 17;16(8):e1008137. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008137. \n\nAdded export and exchange reactions for farnesyl.\n\nAdded R01528 (6pgc_c + nadp_c --> co2_c + nadph_c + ru5p__D_c) which is present accotding to the iHN446 model and BioCyc (but not KEGG).\n\nAdded R00711 (acald_c + h2o_c + nadp_c --> ac_c + 2.0 h_c + nadph_c) which is neither present in BioCyc nor KEGG but has been characterized in: Barthel, T., Jonas, R. & Sahm, H. NADP+-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis . Arch. Microbiol. 153, 95\u2013100 (1989). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00277548\n\nAdded R02164 (q10_c + succ_c <=> fum_c + q10h2_c) together with genes and rule (ZMO0568 and ZMO0569) which are present according to KEGG.\n\nMade nitrogenase (NIT1b) irreversible and allow N2 uptake.\n\nTerpenoid synthesis map from Gerrich Behrendt.\n"}
